- Talk to Dr Chigwa. It turns out that, before his escape, Regis tampered with an awful lot of the plants in the labs. Max analyses it, and it appears that the ones found are acting as components of a piece of video data, and those found so far spell the initials of Max's name (M__L__), with enough gaps for the other letters in her name.
